# HumanElement.Dev

**Systems, craft, and orchestration across domains.**

This GitHub is a public lab for:
- software
- infrastructure
- energy
- food systems
- physical making
- AI-assisted workflows

The goal is not polish — it's *process*.

- 🍞 A micro-bakery as a systems problem
- ⚡ Solar + infrastructure resilience
