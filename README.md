# HumanElement.Dev

## Repository Structure
This repo is organized as a living lab. Each folder is active, incomplete, and evolving.
- /decisions → documented tradeoffs & thinking
- /experiments → short-lived tests and prototypes
- /ops → repeatable processes
- /curriculum → cross-domain learning tracks
- /agents → AI collaborators & workflows

**Systems, craft, orchestration and coherence across domains.**

This GitHub is a public lab for:
- software/code
- infrastructure
- energy
- food systems
- physical making
- AI-assisted workflows

The goal is not polish — it's *process*.
